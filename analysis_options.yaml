# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # Naming conventions
    - camel_case_types
    - camel_case_extensions

    # Formatting rules
    - prefer_single_quotes
    - prefer_const_constructors

    # Avoid magic numbers
    - prefer_typing_uninitialized_variables
    - avoid_returning_null

    # Avoid unused imports
    - avoid_unused_constructor_parameters

    # Null safety
    - always_require_non_null_named_parameters

    # Avoid unnecessary code
    - avoid_redundant_argument_values
    - avoid_returning_this
    - avoid_types_as_parameter_names

    # Best practices
    - prefer_function_declarations_over_variables
    - prefer_inlined_adds
    - prefer_int_literals
    - avoid_relative_lib_imports
    - prefer_if_elements_to_conditional_expressions
    - prefer_if_null_operators
